# Exercise
## Instruction ##

- Zip the 2 lists list_keys and list_values together into one list of (key, value) tuples. Be sure to convert the zip object into a list, and store the result in zipped.
- Inspect the contents of zipped using print(). This has been done for you.
- Construct a dictionary using zipped. Store the result as data.
- Construct a DataFrame using the dictionary. Store the result as df


## Solution ##

# Zip the 2 lists together into one list of (key,value) tuples: zipped
zipped = list(zip(list_keys, list_values))

# Inspect the list using print()
print(zipped)

# Build a dictionary with the zipped list: data
data = dict(zipped)

# Build and inspect a DataFrame from the dictionary: df
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
