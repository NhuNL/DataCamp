EXERCISE

# # Instruction:
- Import numpy using the standard alias np.
- Assign the numerical values in the DataFrame df to an array np_vals using the attribute values.
- Pass np_vals into the NumPy method log10() and store the results in np_vals_log10.
- Pass the entire df DataFrame into the NumPy method log10() and store the results in df_log10.
- Inspect the output of the print() code to see the type() of the variables that you created.


# # Solution 

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create array of DataFrame values: np_vals
np_vals = df.values

# Create new array of base 10 logarithm values: np_vals_log10
np_vals_log10 = np.log10(np_vals)

# Create array of new DataFrame by passing df to np.log10(): df_log10
df_log10 = np.log10(df)

# Print original and new data containers
print(type(np_vals), type(np_vals_log10))
print(type(df), type(df_log10))
